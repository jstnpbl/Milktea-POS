## Learnings

This project was an excellent exercise in building a complete business application using vanilla web technologies. Key challenges overcome include:

- **Complex State Management:** Managing cart state, order calculations, and sales history without a framework required careful JavaScript architecture
- **Responsive Design:** Creating a touch-friendly interface that works across devices while maintaining professional aesthetics
- **Print Integration:** Implementing browser-native printing for receipts required custom CSS and HTML formatting
- **UX/UI Design:** Balancing visual appeal with functional efficiency for a business-critical application
- **Dynamic Menu Expansion:** Implementing a modal and logic for adding new drinks to any category on the fly

The project demonstrates that powerful, professional applications can be built with fundamental web technologies without requiring complex frameworks or build processes.
